# VevDB for Java

This package is the Java 25 Foreign Function & Memory wrapper for VevDB's native
C ABI. It is the lower JVM layer used by the Clojure package.

Build the Java wrapper:

```sh
mvn package
```

This produces the platform-independent Java classes, source jar, and Javadoc
jar. Runtime releases are assembled by the
[VevDB engine repository](https://github.com/vevdb/vev), which adds each
verified native engine library to the Java jar.

The wrapper loads the native library in this order:

1. `-Dvev.library=/path/to/libvev.dylib`
2. `VEV_LIB=/path/to/libvev.dylib`
3. the platform library under `build/lib`
4. bundled classpath resource:
   `com/vevdb/native/<platform>/<mapped-library-name>`

Java 25's FFM API is final. Local runs only need native access enabled:

```sh
--enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED
```

Maven coordinate:

```text
com.vevdb:vev-java
```

The `0.2.0-rc.2` artifact is available from the
[VevDB prerelease](https://github.com/vevdb/vev/releases/tag/v0.2.0-rc.2).
Anonymous resolution by coordinate will begin when the `com.vevdb` namespace
is published to Maven Central. The earlier `v0.1.0-rc.3` artifact used the
provisional `dev.vevdb` coordinate and Java package.

The released Java artifact is the one-dependency entry point for Java
applications. It contains the verified native engines as classpath resources,
so Java users do not list a separate `vev-native-*` dependency.

Basic usage:

```java
try (Vev vev = Vev.load();
     Vev.Connection conn = vev.createConn()) {
    conn.transact("[{:db/id 1 :user/name \"Ada\"}]");
    try (Vev.DB db = conn.db()) {
        System.out.println(vev.queryRows(Map.of(
            "query", "[:find ?name :where [?e :user/name ?name]]",
            "args", List.of(db))));
        System.out.println(db.pull("[:user/name]", 1));
    }
}
```

DB snapshots can also produce entity views. The view is tied to the immutable
DB value, not the live connection:

```java
try (Vev.DB db = conn.db();
     Vev.EntityView ada = db.entity(1);
     Vev.EntityView friend = ada.ref(":user/friend")) {
    System.out.println(ada.get(":user/name"));
    System.out.println(ada.values(":user/email"));
    System.out.println(friend.get(":user/name"));
    System.out.println(ada.touch());
}
```

Parser tooling can inspect a single where clause with
`vev.parseClauseEdn("[?e :user/name ?name]")`.

Transaction functions use a host registry plus a Datomic-style installed ident
in the DB:

```java
try (Vev.TxFunctionRegistry fns = vev.txFunctionRegistry()) {
    fns.register(":user/set-age", (db, args) ->
        "[[:db/add " + args.get(0) + " :user/age " + args.get(1) + "]]");
    conn.transact("[[:db/add 100 :db/ident :user/set-age]]");
    try (Vev.TxReport report =
             conn.transactReport("[[:user/set-age 1 42]]", fns)) {
        System.out.println(report.value());
    }
}
```

The Java callback returns EDN tx-data text. Higher-level clients such as
Clojure can wrap this and let callbacks return ordinary host data. The same
registry shape works for durable `vev.connect("app.vev")` handles.

Typed transaction builders are also accepted by durable connections, so bulk
host writes do not have to round-trip through EDN text:

```java
try (Vev.DurableConnection durable = vev.connect("app.vev");
     Vev.TxBuilder tx = vev.txBuilder(2)) {
    tx.addString(1, ":user/name", "Ada");
    tx.addString(1, ":user/email", "ada@example.com");
    try (Vev.TxReport report = durable.transactReport(tx)) {
        System.out.println(report.value());
    }
}
```

For explicit bulk ingest, pass several builders. VevDB commits them as one
ordinary durable transaction and returns one transaction report:

```java
try (Vev.DurableConnection durable = vev.connect("app.vev");
     Vev.TxBuilder first = vev.txBuilder(1);
     Vev.TxBuilder second = vev.txBuilder(1)) {
    first.addString(2, ":user/name", "Grace");
    second.addString(3, ":user/name", "Hedy");
    try (Vev.TxReport report = durable.transactReport(List.of(first, second))) {
        System.out.println(report.value());
    }
}
```

Successful transaction reports can be observed with a listener registration:

```java
try (Vev.TxReportListenerRegistration listener =
         conn.listen("audit", report -> System.out.println(report))) {
    conn.transact("[{:db/id 2 :user/name \"Grace\"}]");
}
```

The callback receives the decoded report value while the native report handle is
still valid. Keep data you need by copying it into ordinary Java structures
inside the callback.

Durable connections returned by `vev.connect("app.vev")` expose the same
`listen` / `unlisten` API. Durable listener reports are delivered after
successful commits only.

The Java package supports explicit native library paths, but normal consumers
do not need one. The combined release merges each verified platform library
into `com.vevdb:vev-java` as classpath resources such as:

```text
com/vevdb/native/darwin-aarch64/libvev.dylib
com/vevdb/native/darwin-x86_64/libvev.dylib
com/vevdb/native/linux-aarch64/libvev.so
com/vevdb/native/linux-x86_64/libvev.so
com/vevdb/native/windows-x86_64/vev.dll
```

The engine repository's release workflow creates that resource tree for each
platform, verifies that the platform-independent Java classes agree, and
assembles the final cross-platform jar after all platform builds pass:

```text
vev-java-0.2.0-rc.2.jar
vev-native-<platform>-0.2.0-rc.2.jar
vev-clj-0.2.0-rc.2.jar
```

The release gate verifies a fresh Maven project with only
`com.vevdb:vev-java` and a fresh Clojure project with only
`com.vevdb/vev-clj`. Neither consumer selects a platform artifact or configures
a native-library path.

For native integration work, check this repository out beside the engine:

```text
vev/
vev-java/
```

Set `VEV_LIB` or `-Dvev.library` to a locally built engine when running the
source-only Maven build. Normal released artifacts do not need that override.

Durable stores are opened through VevDB APIs with paths such as `app.vev`. The
release native library includes SQLite with FTS5. Java and Clojure applications
do not install or configure SQLite; they load VevDB and call `connect`.
